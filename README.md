# Snyk SBOM API examples

There is a lot of interest at the moment in Software Bill of Materials data. But when you have it, what business problems do you want to solve with it? This repo features some simple examples using the Snyk API.

* [Applying policy to SBOM data](sbom-policy)
* [Validation and conversion to alternative formats](sbom-conversion)
* [Storage and query using a local database](sbom-storage)
* [Combine multiple project SBOMs into a single SBOM](sbom-combination)

If you have other ideas for demos please let me know.
